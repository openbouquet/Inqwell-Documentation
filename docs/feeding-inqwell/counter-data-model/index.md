<h2 id="CounterDataModel-Overview">Counter Data Model</h2>
<p>To serve Counter reports, data has to be sent in a specific manner so Counter rules are met.<br/>We can split required data in 3 categories:</p><ul><li><p>Usage data: related to retrievals &amp; searches events</p></li><li><p>Reference data: related to all metadata describing events: accounts, databases, collections, titles, etc.</p></li><li><p>Subscription data: related to 0 usage management. This Counter requirement allows librarian to know which content is subscribed but not used.</p></li></ul>
