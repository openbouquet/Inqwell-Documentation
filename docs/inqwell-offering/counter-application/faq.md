<h2 id="FAQ-Doesthisapplicationhandleaccountshierarchy?">Does this application handle accounts hierarchy?</h2>

<p>Yes it does, with the help of a parents-childs hierarchy. A parent can have multiple children and a child can have multiple parents.<br/>Also full updates allow to automatically historize configurations for accurate reporting across the time (a child will appear or not depending when it has been added/removed from a hierarchy).<br/>Usage can also be cumulated across hierarchies, or part of them, &amp; be reported at any node of any hierarchy.</p>

<p>Yes it does, with the help of a simplified subscription data model.<br/>Also it allows to handle exclusions in parent child, addition or removal of databases, addition or removal of content within databases.<br/>All these changes are automatically historized for better &amp; accurate reporting across the time:</p><ul><li><p>A content will appear / be removed from 0 usage at the correct time</p></li><li><p>A database will appear / be removed from 0 usage at the correct time</p></li><li><p>And if a child is not granted for some content, this will be also reflected accurately</p></li></ul>
