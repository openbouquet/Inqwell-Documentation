# Getting Started with Inqwell

SquidSolutions offers a Usage Analytics Platform for Scholarly Publishers, an open platform for usage data for the scholarly publishing
community. Inqwell uses the industryâ€™s own COUNTER standard to provide reliable, auditable usage data in an easy and affordable way.

Inqwell provides each publisher with a private destination for their usage data in a secure, hosted environment. Inqwell's unique SSO technology allows you to give access to the applications to your librarians, authors or publishers so they see only their data.
They just have to login to the portal you provide for them.
