<h1>Publisher Application</h1>

<p>The purpose of this document is :</p><ul><li>to explain what is the Publisher Application about</li><li>to express what type of reports are available</li></ul>

Online aggregator websites providers (ProQuest, Ebsco, Project Muse, etc.) regularly provide reports to publishers that are clients of their platform in order to:
- fulfill the legal requirement with Counter Reports 
- feed them usage analytics specifically orientated to the needs.

We propose to set up dashboards to publisher that use different sources and offer various metrics and dimensions. Publishers will have the opportunity to refer to these informal usage dashboards to monitor activities either from an author point of view or an institution, a library, etc.</p>
